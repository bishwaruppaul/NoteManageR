An R Script to manage (create/edit/read) offline plain text note files

Inspired by a couple of great blogs by Derek Sivers (https://sive.rs/plaintext) and Szymon Krajewski (https://szymonkrajewski.pl/taking-notes-in-plaintext/), I created this R Script for my personal use. Taking notes in plain text is rather simplistic, easy, portable and future-proof; and this script provides a great way to organize and manage the notes. 

Why R? Because I love R and use it for my work regularly, and am mostly familiar with the language.

I have created a Windows Batch Script to accompany the R Script. It provides a click-and-run functionality; and otherwise the R Script would require you to open a terminal and soruce the script file.

Note management is done via tags. When creating the note, you have the option of adding tag(s) to the note, which will come in handy later to search notes using the Script. Timestamps are also added to the notes in DD MonthAbbrv YYYY, HH:MM AM/PM format when a new note is created. 


Disclaimer
==========

Though the R Script should run in any system (Windows/MacOS/Linux/others) with R installed, the Batch Script (noteApp.bat) will only work in Windows. I do not have the knowledge of Shell Scripting. If you can, please contribute Shell Scripts for Mac OS and Linux systems.


Important
=========

1. Make sure you have R installed in your system.

2. Make sure that R is in your system path ([Instructions for Windows](https://www.hanss.info/sebastian/post/rtools-path/))


INSTRUCTIONS
============

First, download/git clone the zip file, and unzip it on your machine at your desired location.

OPEN THE SCRIPT:

Double-click on the NoteApp.bat file to open (Windows only), and then follow the on-screen instructions. For MacOS/Linux systems, you may be able to run the script by sourcing the R Script (source("NoteManagerR.R")), or you can write a Shell Script to accompany the R script.

CREATE A NOTE:

Type 'c' to create a new note. The script will display a list of tags present in existing notes for convenience. You can enter existing tag(s) for your new note or enter new tag(s). Then, enter the filename for the new note. Following this, the new note file will open in your system text editor. The new note will have the tags (Tags: ...) and timestamp (Created: ...) at the top. Keeping these top two lines intact, write anything you want inside the note, and save the file.

READ/EDIT A NOTE

Type 'o' to open an existing note. The script will display a list of tags present in existing notes. After you enter one of the tags at the prompt, a list of notes with the tag present will be displayed. To open a note from the list, enter the name of the note, which will open the file in your system text editor. You can read/edit the file. If editing, keep the top two lines intact and save the file at the end.

Enjoy!
